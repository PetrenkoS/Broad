**Options to run the test:**
1. open '/src/test/java/com/ls/broad/tests/RouteTests.java' and run from test class.
2. from terminal using `gradle clean test --tests "RouteTests.getSubwayRoutsInfo"`. In this case you need to open logs in '/build/test-results/test/TEST-....' and you'll find the output there.
